# Hello-world
My first GitHub repository
My name is Chad Solomon! I studied biology and chemistry mostly in my undergraduate degree. After working in a microbiology lab after graduating, I realized I did not want to work 
in a lab. Even if the work was interesting, I did not want to be confined to a lab. I do love science though and the concepts involved so programming was an interest for me
becasue the work can be done from anywhere mostly, and I would not be confined to our current reality even. I am interested in using my programming skills for science simulations.
I am still very new to programming though so I am not ready for simulations yet but so far the learning process has been so fun. I am focusing on being able to get a job in the 
tech industry as a full stack software developer. I am focusing on Java and JavaScript at the moment. I have already developed a pretty strong base in HTML and CSS. 
My hopes are to become proficinet with Java and JavaScript, I know JavaScript is pretty vital currently in the tech industry so I am trying to master JavaScript. 
I look forward to working with others who are tyring to become great developers one day!!!
